The agency is co-owned by Paweł Zimonczyk and Branislav Jašurek and is best known for guiding careers of Slovakia’s golden generation – including Stanislav Lobotka and Dávid Hancko – as well as Polish internationals like Jakub Kiwior, Bartosz Slisz and Szymon Żurkowski. They focus purely on football (players and selected coaches), combining strong local scouting in Slovakia, Poland and the Balkans with placements in Serie A, La Liga, Premier League, MLS and Türkiye. Their differentiator is a “family” approach emphasised by players themselves, backed by a broad multilingual staff network. — — — — — — — — — —",
